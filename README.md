# Developer-Name-Disambiguation

Empirical software engineering research tries to answer questions such as how productive a developer is, the project lead times, or the quality of source code written. To answer such questions, features like project team size, changes, or commits to a project, and developers' experience level are considered. An accurate determination of developer identities in online platforms is crucial since different aliases of the same account would introduce errors into empirical software engineering results. This project uses the dataset provided by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator projects. This dataset is relatively small, with 330 projects, and is trustable. This report explains the steps to scrape the data from the web pages, then explains the pre-processing steps necessary to create a clean dataset. Additionally, data exploration presented in the report reveals signs of an author aliasing problem. Lastly, the reports present three models developed in this project to correctly find author names, complete hidden email IDs, and cluster similar author names. The models developed showed accuracies as high as 99.4% when tested with randomly selected ten projects.
